# jueves
juede jueves made for global game jam 2017

use the keyboard to control the water.
you _can_ submerge the ball.
if the ball is submerged for long enough, it will start to sink, and the game will end.

works best with mbp keyboards (sorry).

fluids dynamics based on http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/talks/GDC2008.pdf and https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpgpu_water
